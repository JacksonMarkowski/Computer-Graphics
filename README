What you should take note of:
  - Spaceship design
  - Moving "lights" on the spaceship
  - Spotlight underneath the spaceship
  - Randomly generated smoke from the crashed spaceship
  - Ability to change the time of day
  - Ability to move the spaceship
  - The third camera mode that automatically follows the spaceship movements

Remains to be done:
  - Add stars in the night sky
  - Smooth transition between night and day
  - Fog/map edge
  - Add more small details
